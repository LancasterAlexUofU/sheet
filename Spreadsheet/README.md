# Overview of the Spreadsheet Project
The Spreadsheet project has many different methods for setting and getting contents of cells
in a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet is able to set cell contents to be either a double, a string,
or a formula. 

The Spreadsheet project can also detect when a cell has referenced back to a previous cell before it, 
creating a loop, even if the cells are indirectly related. If this happens, a CircularException is thrown.
