# Overview of the Spreadsheet GUI

The GUI is currently capable of:

- Setting the contents of the cells
- Displaying the value inside each cell
- Displaying the contents of the cell in the toolbar
- Highlighting the selected cell
- Alert user when attempting to navigate away from a modified spreadsheet
- Showing all relevant info in the header
- Saving as a .sprd
- Loading from a .sprd
- Creating a simple bar chart below the spreadsheet

# Branching

We had minimal branching because we met in person each day to work on the assignment. 
The only branch that was made was to compare our two Spreadsheet models and conduct the code review.

# Time Expenditures

| Assignment | Predicted Hours | Actual Hours|
| :---------:| :-------------: | :---------: |
| Assignment 7 | 15 | 11.5 |

(We met in person for every session, so the total hours were all done together in partnership)

# Time Estimation
## Alex
I believe my time estimates are getting better, as I slightly overestimated for this project.
I have never done pair-programming before, so I wasn't exactly sure how that would affect my time
spent, but overall, I believe it is improving.

## Landon
My time estimations are starting to get more accurate as the assignments progress. 
I feel this is because I am gaining proficiency in csharp and my overall confidence is growing.

# Contributions
This assignment was done completely through partner programming.

# Partnership
There were many times that our partnership was successful. First off, when we did pair-programming,
there where many small errors that were caught by the navigator and we regularly switched off. 
Whenever someone had an idea but was hard to explain, they would take control of the wheel and start implementing. 
Also, by working with a partner, it encouraged us to use more GSP. Since we were there to hold each other
accountable, we would refactor code for DRY, document any confusing code and all methods, and made
code more readable for each other.

One aspect our partnership could work on is having a more defined direction and organization. In the beginning we both 
did not completely understand the assignment which lead to an unclear order of implementing each method. Once we realized
this we both took the time to explain the assignment from our own understanding and fill in the gaps if any came up. From this
point it was much easier to get a plan together and one that we both could follow.
