# Comments for Evaluators
I am assuming, following the assignment instructions, that even if a cell is removed
by passing string.Empty, SetCellContents should still return the cell that was passed in
instead of not returning anything. So, in tests, I will be checking that SetCellContents
still returns the passed-in cell as the correct output  even if it was removed.
